Well, after hours and days of practice hope we'll be able to do simple supervised machine learning projects. Check out link below if you're ready for mini project https://www.youtube.com/c/MotechApp/playlists
Not only that our blog is full of machine learning post, take a review https://www.motechapp.com/blog/
If you have any question ask our machine learning team from here https://www.motechapp.com/ask-question/
Thanks, stay safe and stay positive.
